# Teaching HTML

## Prerequisites

To read and write HTML, students must be able to:
* type with a computer keyboard, including use of code symbols such as `< > { } & ; = " ' !`
* read and reproduce HTML keywords without introducing spelling errors
* create, move, and rename files including file extensions

It is helpful, but not essential, if students can:
* drag select text with the mouse
* copy and paste text with keys or menu options
* indent lines consistently
* use case (upper and lower case characters) consistently
