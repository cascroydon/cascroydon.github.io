A site for members of Croydon's Computing At School hub to share ideas and resources.

Current problems that we need to address:

- student engagement
- access to technology

## Student Engagement

While some students are fully engaging with online delivery, many (perhaps most) students are not. What can we do to improve engagement with students that are struggling to adapt.

## Access to Technology

Many of our students across the borough do not have access to a laptop or PC and a broadband link to our schools or teachers.
