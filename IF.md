* 

## Prerequisites

## Resources

An HTML editor, either
* an online in browser editor with files stored in the cloud, or
* a standalone editor such as Brackets or Notepad
* pen and paper

## Mapping

First break your story into the major decision points. Each decision point forms a node in a network. Write out the decision and circle it. Now draw a line for each alternative. Some decision points will have more than two choices, some may be connecting passages that have a single outward path.

## HTML file framework

Each passage will require an HTML file. Each HTML file will follow a simple structure:
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <body>
            <p>Passage description...</p>
        </body>
    </html>
